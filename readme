the objective of this program is to encrypt and decrypt strings of text using the affine cipher

the current version of the program can only encrypt and decrypt data if a key is provided by user input. future versions will add brute force key generation

this program was created in c++, i am in no way a great programmer so things done in it may not be the correct way but worked and helped acheive the final goal i was looking for.
